# Indonesian-Rainfall-Pattern-Classification-using-Time-Series-K-means
Using time series k-means to cluster three major Indonesian rainfall patterns. The distance computation in the k-means is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which is commonly used for pattern matching and temporal/sequential data clustering.

## Data
